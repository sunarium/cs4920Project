# Chess/Card Game

### Goal

To kill the opponent’s King just as in chess

### The board

- Basic Chess Board
- Mana pile
- Player's hands
- Scrap pile

### Basic Mechanics
- Players will have a King piece at the beginning
- In order to add more pieces to the board, each player must play cards from their hands
- There will be a “mana” based resource (can think of a different name later) which will be used to play cards. To use these resources, “mana” cards will be tapped (turned to their side).
- There will be a combat/battle phase where players can move a piece (based on chess movements) 

### Setup
- Minimum 50 card deck
- Each player begins with a King piece already on the board 
    - Can choose where to place at the start?
    - Limit the places to choose?
- Each player is dealt 6 cards

### Phases of a turn
- Recouperation phase (temporary name)
    - Untapping resources (does not have to physically turn when designing graphics, but need some indication of how much resource to use
    - Draw a card
- Strategy Phase
    - Player can place 1 card from their hand into their mana pile
    - Player can play cards from their hand by paying their mana cost
        - For the moment, all cards will be pieces
        - An extension would be to add action cards
    - Pieces cannot move during the turn they are played
- Action phase
        - Player can select a piece and move them as per chess
- Fall back phase
    - Optional phase where player can play more cards if they have resources left
- End phase
