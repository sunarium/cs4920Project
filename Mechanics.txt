Chess/Card Game
Goal
•	To kill the opponent’s King just as in chess
The board
•	Basic Chess Board
•	Mana pile
•	Player's hands
•	Scrap pile
Basic Mechanics
•	Players will have a King piece at the beginning
•	In order to add more pieces to the board, each player must play cards from their hands
•	There will be a “mana” based resource (can think of a different name later) which will be used to play cards. To use these resources, “mana” cards will be tapped (turned to their side).
•	There will be a combat/battle phase where players can move a piece (based on chess movements) 
Setup
•	Minimum 50 card deck
•	Each player begins with a King piece already on the board 
	o	Can choose where to place at the start?
	o	Limit the places to choose?
•	Each player is dealt 6 cards
Phases of a turn
•	Recouperation phase (temporary name)
	o	Untapping resources (doesn’t have to physically turn when designing graphics, but need some indication of how much resource to use
	o	Draw a card
•	Strategy Phase
	o	Player can place 1 card from their hand into their mana pile
	o	Player can play cards from their hand by paying their mana cost
			For the moment, all cards will be pieces
			An extension would be to add action cards
	o	Pieces cannot move during the turn they are played
•	Action phase
	o	Player can select a piece and move them as per chess
•	Fall back phase
	o	Optional phase where player can play more cards if they have resources left
•	End phase
